      This interface provides notifications of lock and unlock events.
      Only one client at a time can bind to this interface.
      You may want to restrict this interface to whitelisted clients.

        This request indicates that the client will not use the lock screen

    <event name="locked">
      <description summary="outputs are locked">
        This event is sent by the compositor when outputs needs to be locked.
        It is also sent when the client binds to the interface, if the outputs are
        already locked at that time.

        Surfaces on locked outputs might still be visible for a while even after
        this event is sent, due to an animation of the lock screen.

     <request name="unlock">
      <description summary="unlock outputs">
        Let the compositor know the user has successfully entered a password,
        PIN or any other supported authentication method.

    </request>

    <request name="destroy" type="destructor">
      <description summary="destroy the handle">
        This request destroys the handle.

        Destroying an active handle without unlocking first will keep the
        output locked. The compositor might still hide all surfaces, but
        that really depends on the implementation.
